# Micropython module for a 128x64 OLED screen
This is a Micropython module for driving a 128x64 OLED screen.  
It relies on a slightly modified version of the [SSD1306 driver from Micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/drivers/display/ssd1306.py) and on the standard Micropython ``framebuf`` module.
